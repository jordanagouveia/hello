<p>Today, we are going to look at photos of my dogs! We will start 
    from the smallest and work our way to the largest.</p>
<p>Meet Rosie. She's approximately 12lbs (possibly the runt of her litter) 
    and believed to be a Rat Terrier mix. She has her 13th birthday coming 
    up in a month. She loves going everywhere with me in the car and gets 
    really excited at drive through windows because the Starbucks employees 
    have spoiled her. Now she expects treats from the pharmacy window and 
    bank, too! She is also known as Rosalita, Rose, and Lil Silk. I adopted 
    her and her sister, Daisy, when they were just 8 weeks old.</p>

<p>Next up is Daisy! This is Rosie's littermate and sister. Quite a bit 
    taller, she's also quite heavier at 16lbs. Obviously, we will celebrate 
    her 13th birthday next month, as well. Daisy enjoys chasing anything that
     moves in the backyard (or above it). She loves barking at birds flying
      over. She's a wonderful huntress and is known to bring an occasional 
      gift to her humans. Most recently, it was a petrified lizard. Her 
      nicknames are DeeDee and DaisyBug. </p>

<p> This is Josie, AKA JoJo and FastPaws. Josie was found in a ditch with 
    her two siblings at only a day or two old. Luckily, a rescue in South 
    Carolina new of a common "litter ditching area" and regularly scoped 
    the area. All three puppies survived and as soon as Josie was old enough,
     we adopted her into our pack. She turned one last month and we had a 
     fantastic little birthday party for her. She is the most generous of 
     all our dogs. Anytime someone enters the room, Josie will present them
      with one of her toys, displaying it proudly. She's a very affectionate
       dog and super cuddly. We had no idea what her breed was when we first
        got her, but as she's growing, she looks more and more like a Dutch 
        Shepherd. She's about 35lbs and the fastest of all our dogs!</p>

<p>Say hello to Drake! Drake is a little over 10 years old and a Belgian 
    Malinois. He weighs approximately 70lbs. Drake has a super cool backstory.
     My husband served 10 years in the Air Force as a k9 handler. Right 
     after the handlers graduate their course, they are assigned their 
     first working dog. Drake had just graduated his puppy course to become
      an explosive ordinance dog (aka bomb dog). They were assigned to each 
      other and learned along the way. Once my husband was sent to a new 
      duty station, they were separated. He vowed to adopt Drake when he 
      retired. It can be somewhat difficult to track a military working dog.
       They switch handlers and duty stations somewhat often. Last Fall, my 
       husband got word Drake's last handler kept him after he was retired.
        My husband was absolutely devastated. The current handler always 
        gets first dibs, so there was no fighting it. About 2 months later,
         my husband got an e-mail from the handler state he was being moved 
         to England and did not want to put undue travel stress on Drake 
         during his retirement (he has definitely been on enough overseas
          flights). He asked my husband if he was still interested in having
           Drake. Next thing I know, Drake is on a flight from Hawaii to Texas,
            courtesy of a foundation that helps relocate retired service dogs.
             They drove him from Texas to our front door in North Carolina 
             to reunite him with my husband. The two have been inseparable 
             since. Drake is loving his retired life with our pack and is 
             learning how to be a regular dog. Our other dogs have taught him
              how to beg, relax, and wrestle in the backyard. He's such a 
              little lover.  </p>

<p>This is Leo! He was Carson when we picked him up from the animal shelter 
    in Colorado as a puppy. He had been returned twice at only 12 weeks old.
     Previous adopters stated he was to rambunctious and shredded shoes. We 
     love puppies and challenges. So, Carson became Leo Leopold Nicodemus 
     Renaldi on the way home with us that day. He's now 106lbs and like a
      bull in a china shop wherever he is. I'm not exaggerating. He swung 
      his backside around knocking my mother-in-law over last year. She 
      broke her ankle! He is a Rhodeisian Ridgeback and possibly mixed. He 
      turns 5 this July and will most likely have a pool party in the 
      backyard with lots of snacks. This chunky boy lives for snacks.
       We call him by his full name on occassion, but I mainly call him 
       Vulture. He likes hovering over the other dogs until they are done 
       eating so he can lick their bowls, too! Besides scavenging for snacks,
        his favorite activities include sunning himself on the back deck and 
        giving kisses.</p>

<p>Last but not least, meet Mica (mi-cuh). She is 85% Gray Wolf and 15% 
    Malamute. She's the alpha of our pack and respected by all of the other
     dogs. She doesn't bark like the others, but will occassionally howl 
     (it's a beautiful sound). My husband adopted her from someone while 
     living in Japan. She was getting bullied by their other dogs and she 
     was just a wolf pup at the time. She had some very bad habits when he 
     first had her, but she's been broken of 98% of them. She's still a bit
      food aggressive, but the other dogs know to steer clear (even Leo). 
      She does not respond to commands unless there are treats in hand. Her
       favorite activies include laying outside when it's cold, howling at 
       me right after I sit down to get up and either let her out or get her
        a treat, and napping. She used to love swimming in the ocean, but 
        we haven't taken her here. She has many nicknames! Mimi, Stinky 
        (she doesn't smell), Stinkbug (I don't know why my husband calls her
         this), Princess, Mama, and Pretty Lil Wolfgirl are a few commonly 
         used. Mica turns 10 this September and will enjoy a steak (on the 
         rare side) for her dinner that day. She's had 9 birthday steaks 
         with us. She weighs around 125lbs and is quite tall. On her hind 
         legs, she can easily drape her paws over my husbands shoulders and 
         he's 6'2"!</p>
